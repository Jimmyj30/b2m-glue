# b2m-glue

Gluing all the parts of the book-to-movie project together

## To add:

Docker-compose with dummy producer and dummy consumer.

In "production" we can have a flask app, the text-to-audio pipeline, and the text-to-images pipeline runnning.

## Development

This can be run locally (no GPU needed AFAIK)
